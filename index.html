            <h1>Good Intentions and Their Actual Effects: Efforts to Achieve Peace Between 1953 and 1960, and Why They Failed</h1>

    In a speech delivered before the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
    April 1953, Eisenhower encouraged nations of the world to unite in global
    peace. The “Chance for Peace” speech, named because of the opening line of
    the speech, was held one month after the death of Josef Stalin in March.
    Despite the fact that his administration was undecided in terms of how to
    deal with Stalin’s death, Eisenhower addressed the matter directly: “Now a
    new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the
    past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great
    part, its own to make.” Its past, Eisenhower said, was shaped by "World
    War”, implicitly pointing out that the world was yet to see a Soviet system
    work during peacetime. Thus, with only a strain of optimism for the future,
    Eisenhower remained skeptical about the possibility that the Soviet Union
    would “ awaken … Will it do this?”, he asked suspiciously.<a href="#1">[1]</a> This shows that
    trust between United States and Soviet Union remained porous during the
    Eisenhower administration. Although, as Melvyn Leffler points out in For
    the Soul of Mankind, there might have been a window for peace in 1953-54
    but with the revelation of U-2, global intervention and the lack of results
    in negotiations over the German thorn, that window gradually closed. “The
    world seemed too frightening;” Leffler asserts, “it also seemed too full of
    opportunity.”<a href="#2">[2]</a> In this essay, I argue that the struggle over Third World
    nationalism undermined the hope of peace between United States and the
    Soviet Union. Both Washington and Moscow all sought to limit defense
    spending in their nations; however, the Cold War leaders did not achieve
    détente entirely. Furthermore, the struggle for the hearts and minds of the
    globe increased spending on public diplomacy and foreign aid as other Cold
    War weapons. Domestic politics and economics put pressure
    on the leaders to show action with regards to their foreign policies.
</p>

<p>
    This essay is structured around the role of the Dulles brothers as I argue
    that their views of the Soviet Union decelerated peace negotiations. As
    director of CIA and Secretary of State, respectively Allen Welsh and John
    Foster<a href="#3">[3]</a> were primary agents alongside Eisenhower in the shaping of foreign
    relations during his administration. The Dulles brothers were raised in a
    Presbyterian Calvinist belief with an emphasis on missionary Christianity.
    As Stephen Kinzer argues in his biography, The Brothers, the Dulles
    brothers’ world was essentially a binary battle between good and evil, and
    the dividing line between them was definite and clear: “[This worldview]
    crystallized the Cold War paradigm”.<a href="#4">[4]</a> I believe that this can help explain
    why the chances for peace did not develop any further.
</p>

    <h3>EDC, Dulles Brothers and Possibilities for Peace</h3>

<p>
    In the following, I give some examples of how the possibilities for peace
    between 1953-55 can be perceived as a complicated and sensitive web of
    contingencies, agencies and international negotiation. In the center of the
    division between Moscow and Washington was the issue of Germany. Evidently,
    Germany had been a central issue in the immediate postwar years; however,
    the German composition was quintessential for the peace movement 1953-55
    for several reasons. Germany was significant to U.S. and the Soviet Union
    for both national security, economy and military reasons. In 1952, Foster,
    suggested a European Defense Community (EDC) that should establish a
    European military force. This included the rebuild of a West German
    military power to the same level as its other NATO allies. Foster was
    highly concerned with a fortification of Germany as a bulwark against the
    Red Army, which was twice the size of U.S. forces in Europe.<a href="#5">[5]</a> So, despite
    U.S. superiority in missiles and bombers, Foster saw an opportunity to
    utilize NATO in order to deter any form of Soviet aggression. It is evident
    from a letter to U.S. representative in the Allied High Commission, James
    Bryant Conant, that Foster realized the threat of a German army restored:
    “I noted your views with reference to a national German army within the
    NATO framework. I myself consider that this would be a most unsatisfactory
    alternative to European unity.”<a href="#6">[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
    One could make the argument that if European unity was a principal goal for
    the State Department, the promise of a supranational military force would
    stabilize the relationship between NATO allies because of a common
    obligation among Western European countries and United States. However, the
    opposite turned out to be the case. Especially the other occupational
    forces, France and Great Britain, remained concerned with an operative
    German military force. As Kevin Ruane points out, “at a basic emotional
    level, few people in France really desired the rearmament of their old
    enemy in any shape or form”.<a href="#1">[7]</a> A failure to integrate West Germany into a
    Western unified force would destabilize Europe as a whole, Dulles feared.
    Melvyn Leffler quotes one of Dulles’ aides, Perry Laukhuff: “Germans may be
    tempted to adopt a more independent policy, which might be accompanied by a
    rapid growth of extreme nationalism, or an increase in Soviet-Communist
    influence, depending on the circumstances”.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Eisenhower shared the concern
    as he worried that lack of action in Europe essentially might “allow that
    Continent to fall into Soviet hands”.<a href="#9">[9]</a> And yet, Paris remained concerned and
    reluctant to approve the treaty. In August 1954 they officially rejected
    EDC. Famously, Foster had warned about an “agonizing reappraisal” of U.S.
    forces in West Europe and what was called “peripheral defense" of the
    European continent.<a href="#10">[10]</a> Paris, however, was not convinced that Foster would
    take drastic action because of the importance of Europe. And rightfully so.
    When the deadline was surpassed, Foster did no take drastic action in terms
    of his nation’s relation in NATO, but he grew disappointed, distressed and
    bitter with the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, as well as
    Churchill’s reconciliatory line against the Soviet Union during the Bermuda
    Conference in 1953.<a href="#11">[11]</a>
</p>

<p>
    Eventually, the Brussels Treaty was redefined during the Paris Agreements
    in 1955, which led to the formation of Western European Union. A defense
    organism was thus secured in Western Europe, albeit with lesser
    supranationality than Foster had hoped. Nonetheless, FGR was admitted into
    NATO, as was Italy, and U.S., France and Great Britain ratified the end of
    their occupation obligation in FGR.<a href="#12">[12]</a> What is clear is that Dulles was
    stubborn in his wish to keep at least West Germany under Western influence.
    Eisenhower shared this view, but Foster was the man in the field and his
    personal views of the Cold War conflict might be decisive in a successful
    integration of West Germany into NATO. Furthermore, the threat of a
    communist uprising in Italy was also minimized with Italian admission in
    NATO. On the other hand, Foster’s consistency did not ease tensions between
    East and West. For example, his outright dismissal of Churchill’s view that
    the West should not “‘… dismiss the possibility’ that there was a new
    disposition in Moscow” might derive from a discontent with Western European
    powers’ decision on EDC and certainly did not lead to reconciliation with
    Soviet Union.<a href="#13">[13]</a> One might even suggest that the outcome of the Paris
    Agreement reflected the original French concern with EDC that it “posed an
    obstacle to East-West détente”, as Ruane points out.<a href="#14">[14]</a> As Foster pushed for
    the formation of EDC and WEU, the establishment of the equivalent Warsaw
    Pact was in motion behind the Iron Curtain.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, Foster’s Christian morality and steady personality appealed to
    Konrad Adenauer of FRG, with whom he had several meetings. Adenauer was
    also a traditional Christian and the head of the Christian Democratic
    Party. Stephen Kinzer presents how Foster even supported Adenauer in the
    1953 election because he shared Foster’s “anti-Communist militancy and
    denounced the Soviet Union in terms Foster could approve”.<a href="#15">[15]</a> He even goes so
    far as to suggesting that Foster’s good relation with Adenauer also
    affected Allen as he established an underground tunnel from West Berlin to
    the East from where CIA could carry out spy intelligence missions. At
    least, both Dulles brothers were deeply entangled in U.S. foreign affairs
    in 1953-55. The question of Germany lingered throughout the 1950s.
</p>


    <h3> New Leadership Behind the Curtain and the Geneva Summit</h3>


<p>
    After the “A Chance for Peace” speech, Eisenhower received broad support at
    home and abroad. But Foster was reluctant to accept the seemingly
    conciliatory course Eisenhower had hinted at in his speech. He wanted to
    see U.S. foreign policy as vigorous and full of agency. Strength was the
    commonality between his two trademark ideas: massive retaliation and the
    “roll-back” of communism. Symbolically, he emphasized that Soviet Union was
    on a “peace defensive” rather than a “peace offensive”.<a href="#16">[16]</a> So, it seems,
    Foster did not at any point think a peace agreement with the Soviet Union
    was realistic. Moscow was irritated by Eisenhower’s “Chance for Peace”
    speech, but was outright antagonized by Foster’s later remarks about the
    Soviet Union.<a href="#17">[17]</a> Furthermore, one has only to glance at the numbers to realize
    how vague the possibilities for peace were during the Eisenhower
    administration. The U.S. nuclear stockpile rose from 1,200 to 22,229 and “a
    million Americans served overseas in forty-two countries.”<a href="#18">[18]</a>
</p>

<p>
    Washington and Moscow did have “coexistence cocktails” consisting
    appropriately of Vodka and Coke after the Geneva Summit in 1955, where the
    two adversaries had agreed on Austrian independence. Consequently, the
    “spirit of Geneva” denotes reconciliation in the Cold War rhetoric between
    Moscow and Washington. However, the agreement must be seen in the light of
    both EDC and the Warsaw Pact, which essentially were military
    fortifications of East and West and thus, not quite the deescalation the
    world had hoped for. Furthermore, prior to the Geneva Summit, a meeting of
    the National Security Council, where both Foster and Allen were present,
    had emphasized that ”the U.S. approach to the Geneva Conference should be
    based on the view that the position of the Soviet Union was weakening and
    that we should accordingly hold its feet to the fire”.<a href="#19">[19]</a> In other words,
    Washington was aware of maintaining the upper hand and not allowing Moscow
    to take advantage of the situation. However, cultural exchange initiatives
    were launched and talks about arms control had taken place.
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, behind the iron curtain, Stalin’s death spurred an indecisive
    period in Kremlin as there was no clear logic to follow in terms of who was
    to take control of the Soviet Union. One could argue that the only hope for
    peace between 1953 and 1960 was the fact that the Kremlin top leadership
    had to redefine a course for the Soviet Union that was not anchored in
    Stalin’s persona. Although this can be said to be true for the immediate
    period following Stalin’s death, Khrushchev was not intent on accepting
    U.S. discrete aggressions such as U-2 and Third World foreign aid, once he
    became Premier in 1958. Despite Stalin’s endeavors to create a “a new
    identity [in Soviet, and] … a new international order dedicated to peace”,
    his death became a manifestation of a Soviet shift.<a href="#20">[20]</a>
</p>

<p>
    Soviet agitation for peace stemmed from a growing discontent among the
    Soviet people. Under Stalin, the Soviet people “had been convinced that the
    hardships they had endured through collectivization, the purges, and World
    War II” would lead to recuperation in Soviet society.<a href="#21">[21]</a> The new Kremlin,
    Malenkov, Khrushchev, Molotov and Beria, agreed on the necessity of
    “[relaxing] tensions in order to focus on domestic priorities, redefine
    their goals, and buttress their values”.<a href="#22">[22]</a> Furthermore, the Soviet Union
    contained many nations and Malenkov stressed the necessity of portraying
    the Soviet system as a good system that was “work[ing] for the people” in
    order to establish peaceful relations and avoid uprisings in the East.<a href="#23">[23]</a> So,
    Moscow still resented the U.S. and the West but it is clear that their
    pursuit for some kind of peaceful reconciliation was central to their
    policy.
</p>

<p>
    Paradoxically, both Washington and Moscow sought to decrease the defense
    budget in order to protect the public good. Eisenhower would later warn
    against the military-industrial complex, and Kremlin wanted improved
    relations with the West because that would lead to lower spending on
    defense and foreign relations and instead improve domestic life in Soviet
    Union. Thus, they shared the view on economic advantages of détente.
</p>



    <h3>Third World Nationalism and the Struggle for the Hearts and Minds</h3>


<p>
    Truman had sent Foster to Japan in 1951 to oversee the implication of U.S.
    foreign policy in the turmoil of the Korean War, and in 1952, Foster was
    instrumental in negotiating the Japanese peace treaty. Foster saw a
    peaceful rebuild of Japan as most favorable to U.S. foreign affairs in the
    region, because it would help deter the Chinese Communists not to make any
    expansion in Japan. So, the well-known phrase that Foster and Eisenhower
    saw the whole world through a Cold War prism adds to the image of Foster as
    a cold warrior within foreign relations.<a href="#24">[24]</a> One could have expected that the
    case of Japan could have added to an internationalist worldview; however,
    the opposite seems the case.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, Foster was the executive agent of strong international
    leadership, which Eisenhower had called for. Furthermore, Eisenhower needed
    Foster to be vigorous and tactical in his diplomatic affairs as the first
    priority of his New Look was to make national security affordable. This is
    one of the reasons why the former WWII General Eisenhower restored his
    faith in strong diplomacy; it was simply the most affordable, if one used
    it properly. Foster was instrumental in sketching out the strategy of
    massive retaliation on the exact same basis. Nuclear blackmail would become
    a diplomatic tool. However, Foster would not strike any deal possible. His
    loathing of the Soviet Union system was strong to the extent that he was
    willing to risk antagonizing the East-West divide even more. Such was the
    case of the Suez Crisis in 1956, where Foster refused to accept Gamal Abdel
    Nasser’s wish to nationalize the Suez Canal under Egyptian control.
    Furthermore, Foster was almost paranoiacally fearing the nationalist
    movements in the Third World.<a href="#25">[25]</a>
</p>

<p>
    It is important to note the connection between capitalism and colonialism.
    U.S. was prone to anti-colonial criticism by former colonies that sought
    independence; U.S. meant capitalism and capitalism meant exploitation of
    colonies’ resources and people. Eisenhower evoked the domino theory to
    describe his fear over the situation: If one nation were to fall for an
    attractive communist Soviet system, there was no limit to the expansion of
    communism. Thus, nationalist developments in the Third World, which was
    formalized by the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in 1955, helped stir
    tensions between East and West as Eisenhower feared the shift of balance.
    One might argue whether Washington saw ghosts given the fact that Prime
    Minister Nehru of India, and other leaders, announced their non-alignment
    in the Cold War struggle.<a href="#26">[26]</a> Khrushchev realized the importance of new
    emergence nations, and how they played a role in the international
    configuration of power. Thus, he supported nationalist movements and sought
    to exert anti-colonial against the Western imperial enterprise.
</p>

<p>
    However, at the same time, both nations wanted to avoid any heated conflict
    in Asia and Africa. Public and cultural diplomacy thus became their primary
    weapon in the area, which shows that the global struggle between Washington
    and Moscow was muricate and full of indirect confrontation, despite the
    fact that Geneva had officially initiated some cooperation in 1955. The
    Dulles brothers remained significant in the deployment of public diplomatic
    initiatives abroad: The United States Information Agency was added under
    the State Department in 1952 and CIA orchestrated operations in the region
    that sought to heighten U.S. influence.
</p>



   <h3>Icarus: U-2 and Paris</h3>


<p>
    As a title for this section, I apply Monte Reel’s mythic approach to the
    history of CIA’s U-2 project because I believe it conveys an understanding
    of the high risk and somewhat dubious nature of the project, which
    eventually broke the trust between Washington and Moscow.
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile hope for peaceful coexistence was nurtured in Geneva, Edwin Land
    worked with another Dulles behind another curtain on the U-2 project, which
    became a new hot button of peace negotiations. Allen Dulles believed in the
    efficiency of covert operations in U.S. foreign relations. Thus, he shared
    his brother’s pragmatic attitude. He had also shared his brother’s view
    that EDC was essential as the Soviets sought to obstruct negotiations about
    a unified Western European military force. He confirmed Dullesian hostility
    towards peace negotiations with the Soviet Union. He stated that there was
    “no ground for the belief that there would be any change in the basic
    hostility of the Soviet Union to the free world”.<a href="#27">[27]</a> The U-2 was no exception.
</p>

<p>
    The Guatemalan Coup in 1954 had proved the legitimacy of CIA’s cover
    operations and furthermore, Allen recognized Richard Bissell’s
    accomplishments in the overthrow of Arbenz, so he eventually made him
    responsible for “a new covert project on his own”.<a href="#28">[28]</a> Allen had been sceptical
    about implementing technological development as part of CIA’s programs. He
    believed in traditional spy missions, and as Reel points out, Allen was
    “hooked on [Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels]”.<a href="#29">[29]</a> However, Eisenhower
    understood the value of recognizance in war situations, and the prospects
    of Edwin Land’s technological accomplishment quickly convinced the former
    WWII General. In the end, Allen and the head of covert intelligence, Frank
    Wisner, were convinced of the transformative impact of U-2 on the agency.<a href="#30">[30]</a>
</p>

<p>
    One could question the reasons why Allen gave up the responsibility for the
    project. As Monte Reel also argues, he remained at some distance and had
    not even been overseeing the U-2 plane’s first flight. Perhaps Allen had
    some doubts as to the new intelligence technology. Was it really going to
    work? Furthermore, one could speculate that if Allen had had more faith in
    the project from the beginning, the outcome could have been different. But
    Eisenhower maintained that he should authorize every flight over Soviet
    territory because of the delicate nature of U-2 missions, rightfully one
    might add. If something went wrong, he had to take the full responsibility.
    This can possibly also have been a way of showing Khrushchev how Eisenhower
    was in charge of his administration, especially in the context of the
    absence of Foster, who represented a “[madman]”, Khrushchev told the
    Politburo.<a href="#31">[31]</a> Thus, while Khrushchev agreed to meet with Eisenhower to discuss
    the neutralization of Berlin in 1959 and eventually at the Paris Summit in
    1960, Allen worked on covert initiatives to overthrow Castro in Cuba, which
    eventually would lead to the failure of the invasion at Bay of Pigs.
    Furthermore, Allen and Bissell put pressure on Eisenhower to approve
    another round of flights. Because he feared a diplomatic backfire at Paris,
    no flights were approved after 1 May, 15 days before the summit. On this
    day, however, Gary Powers was shot down by a Soviet MiG, which slingshot
    Cold War peace negotiations back into a deadlock of mistrust. Overall, the
    complex year between 1959 and 1960 shows how Eisenhower had to balance
    between his administration, NSC and CIA, who pushed for more covert action
    and his genuine desire to reach a peaceful agreement with Khrushchev.
    Allen’s view of the Soviet Union and his subsequent course for CIA seemed
    to disrupt Eisenhower’s endeavors.
</p>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>
    The Dulles brothers were powerful voices in Washington as they were the
    president’s closest aides within two important fields: foreign affairs and
    national security. They shared a belief in pragmatic
    foreign policy as which I understand their determination to take action in
    order to eliminate the threat and influence of the Soviet Union in Germany,
    the Third World and Cuba. Yet, one might ask whether the Soviet leaders
    were concerned with Western Europe to the extent that Eisenhower and Dulles
    feared. The Soviet seemed to awaken on wholly new terms, but U.S. foreign
    policy initiatives made reconciliation difficult. The WEU meant that U.S.
    forces were stationed in Europe as part of a NATO alliance on a permanent
    basis. This was highly enforced by Dulles’ threat assessment of the dangers
    of Soviet Union in Europe at the time.
</p>

<p>
    Foster had a cancer surgery in 1956, which made him passive during crucial
    moments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and he eventually died in
    1959. However, the spirit of Foster largely lingered in the New Look
    strategy, which affected U.S. foreign policy throughout the Eisenhower
    administration, as well as in his younger brother who shared his hostility
    towards the Soviet Union.
</p>

<p>
    The situation in Moscow and the uncertainty of the
    Kremlin was the main possibility for peace in 1953. Khrushchev’s visit to
    the United States in 1959, which was an indirect result of the spirit of
    Geneva, offered a small opportunity for reconciliation. However, in the
    light of present day access to information about the U-2 program, there
    were matters that complicated a peaceful success even before Powers left
    Earth in 1960.

                   <p>Been diving into the Reagan Era these days. I think I might be approaching an understanding of the 1980 election, although a few things remain confusing, absurd at times.</p>
                   <p>I think the point that Reagan was not Carter is partly valid and partly completely incomprehensible. Maybe I'm blindfolded by the aspect of retrospect, but it seems oddly absurd that the majority of the American population thought that Carter was the problem, when some serious incidents were simply out of his hands.</p>
                   <p>Was Reagan the precursor for the 2016 election? At least, he was a populist who made remarkable statements. He also included the words, "Make America Great Again", in his campaign election. </p>
