            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p><b>1848</b> is a blog about American cultural history. It is developed on the basis of a platform to share perspectives on American Studies from a variety of disciplines. I do not intend to promote myself or my own career as much as I wish to have a platform for doing some writing.</p>
         <p>As academics in the contemporary world, we must be careful not to follow capitalistic trends that require us to make a living of something. We must be careful not to limit research to members of the faculty staff at the universities. It must be accessible and open. Otherwise, our place in this world becomes obsolete.</p>
         <p>This website is open source and unlimited. I encourage anyone to participate in the sharing of views and knowledge of American Studies here. If you do not know how to setup your device with this webpage, please let me know. I'll also be happy to receive Word documents with your content.</p>

                   <p>Been diving into the Reagan Era these days. I think I might be approaching an understanding of the 1980 election, although a few things remain confusing, absurd at times.</p>
                   <p>I think the point that Reagan was not Carter is partly valid and partly completely incomprehensible. Maybe I'm blindfolded by the aspect of retrospect, but it seems oddly absurd that the majority of the American population thought that Carter was the problem, when some serious incidents were simply out of his hands.</p>
                   <p>Was Reagan the precursor for the 2016 election? At least, he was a populist who made remarkable statements. He also included the words, "Make America Great Again", in his campaign election. </p>
